# Assignment: Number guessing game  
Objective: Write a program that generates a random number between __1 and 100__, then asks the user to guess it until they get it right.  
## Requirements:  
### Random number:
* Use `rand()` seeded with `time(0)`  `<stdlib.h>`, `<time.h>`  
* Range: 1–100.  
### User input loop:  
* Keep asking until correct.  
* Tell user if their guess is too high or too low.  
### Track attempts:
* Count how many guesses were made.  
* At the end, print "You guessed it in X attempts!".  
### Bonus:
* If user enters something outside 1–100, print "Invalid guess. Try again." and don’t count it.
